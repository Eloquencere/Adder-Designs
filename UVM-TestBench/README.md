# UVM testbench
## Description
This project focuses on the development of a generalized UVM testbench for the simultaneous verification of multiple 16-bit adder designs. The testbench reduces code complexity and simulation time, making it a scalable solution for adder design verification. It ensures over 80% code coverage for each design using unique test cases, orchestrated via a virtual sequence. The testbench also features sequential instantiation of interfaces and adders, dynamic creation and assignment of agents per design, a scoreboard for real-time result calculation, and a custom report server for enhanced readability of UVM messages. This approach increases automation and efficiency in the verification process.
